## Description
The Weather App is a web-based application that provides real-time weather information for any location. It fetches weather data from a weather API and displays key information such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and cloud cover. The app offers two main features: the ability to search for weather information in any city and the option to display the user's local weather based on their device's location.

## Features
- **Search by City:** Users can enter the name of a city to view its current weather conditions.
- **User Location:** With user permission, the app can access the device's location and display local weather data.
